## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-06

### Added
- Initial release of AI Agents Reality Check benchmark suite
- Three agent architectures: WrapperAgent, MarketingAgent, RealAgent
- Comprehensive statistical analysis with Cohen's h and confidence intervals
- Multi dimensional testing: performance, resilience, ensemble coordination
- CLI interface with extensive commands and options
- Enhanced benchmarking with tool failure simulation
- Network condition modeling across multiple states
- Ensemble pattern evaluation (Pipeline, Parallel, Hierarchical, Consensus, Specialization)
- Statistical output formats (JSON, enhanced analysis)
- Comprehensive passing unit test suite
- Academic grade methodology documentation

### Key Discoveries
- Seventy three point performance gap between Real and Wrapper agents
- Zero positive synergy rate across all ensemble patterns
- Pipeline ensemble pattern shows zero success rate (complete failure)
- Nine times resilience difference under network stress conditions
- Marketing agents show highly variable performance indicating shallow architecture
- Real agents maintain high success rates even under adverse conditions

### Features
- Mathematical rigor with proper statistical validation
- Reproducible benchmarks with seeded randomization
- Zero framework dependencies (no popular agent libraries)
- Production ready architecture with comprehensive error handling
- Multi complexity task evaluation (Simple, Moderate, Complex, Enterprise)
- Rich console output with progress tracking and visualization
- Trace based analysis with JSON schema validation
- Multi agent coordination overhead measurement

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with empirical results and screenshots
- Usage guide with CLI reference and examples
- Evaluation methodology with statistical validation
- Contributing guidelines for open source collaboration
- Self reliant research approach without external citations

### Performance Benchmarks
- WrapperAgent: consistently poor success rates
- MarketingAgent: highly variable success rates
- RealAgent: robust performance across all conditions
- Network resilience: significant performance differential under stress
- Ensemble coordination: All patterns underperform individual agents
