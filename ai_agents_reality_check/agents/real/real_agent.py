Module: ai_agents_reality_check/agents/real/real_agent.py

Production-grade agent implementation featuring hierarchical planning, semantic
memory, multi-strategy recovery, and comprehensive execution tracing. The RealAgent
represents the architectural sophistication required for reliable autonomous task
completion, achieving 75-93% success rates across complexity levels.

This implementation demonstrates proper agent architecture through modular
subsystems including planning, execution, memory management, and error recovery,
providing a benchmark for evaluating the performance gap between shallow wrapper
implementations and production-ready agent systems.

    """Production-grade autonomous agent with hierarchical planning and semantic memory.

    The RealAgent implements a sophisticated agent architecture featuring multi-layer
    memory systems, hierarchical planning with semantic reuse, multi-strategy error
    recovery, and comprehensive execution tracing. This agent serves as the benchmark
    for production-ready autonomous systems, demonstrating the architectural complexity
    required to achieve reliable task completion rates of 75-93%.

    The agent maintains three distinct memory systems: working memory for current
    task context, episodic memory for execution history, and semantic memory for
    plan reuse and optimization. Error recovery mechanisms include retry logic,
    fallback strategies, and graceful degradation patterns.

    Attributes:
        name (str): Human-readable agent identifier.
        api_call_cost (float): Base cost per API operation.
        execution_history (List[TaskResult]): Complete task execution history.
