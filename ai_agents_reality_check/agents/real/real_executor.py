Module: ai_agents_reality_check/agents/real/real_executor.py

Production-grade execution engine for RealAgent featuring coordinated subgoal
processing, comprehensive error recovery, and detailed execution tracing.
Implements the execution layer that enables RealAgent's superior performance
through sophisticated tool orchestration and multi-strategy error handling.

This module provides the execution infrastructure that differentiates production-
grade agents from shallow wrapper and marketing implementations, delivering
the reliability and robustness required for autonomous task completion.

    """Execute hierarchical plan through coordinated subgoal processing with recovery.

    Orchestrates sequential execution of plan subgoals with comprehensive error
    handling, recovery mechanisms, and detailed tracing infrastructure. Implements
    the sophisticated execution pipeline that enables RealAgent's superior performance
    through tool coordination, memory management, and graceful error recovery.

    The execution process maintains detailed working memory state, coordinates with
    recovery systems for failed operations, and provides comprehensive tracing for
    analysis and debugging. This represents the execution sophistication required
    for production-grade autonomous agent performance.

    Args:
        plan (Dict[str, Any]): Hierarchical execution plan containing:
            - task_id (str): Unique task identifier for memory coordination
            - subgoals (List[Dict[str, Any]]): Ordered execution steps with:
            - tool (str): Tool name for step execution
            - trace (Dict[str, Any]): Tracing infrastructure for timing
            - Additional step-specific parameters
            - Additional plan metadata for execution coordination
        working_memory (Dict[str, Any]): Active memory system containing:
            - Task-specific execution context and state tracking
            - Tool usage history and completed step records
            - Step history for recovery system coordination
            - Runtime parameters and coordination data
        speed_multiplier (float, optional): Execution speed modifier for testing
            scenarios. Values > 1.0 accelerate execution, < 1.0 slow execution.
            Defaults to 1.0 for normal production speed.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Updated plan object with execution results including:
            - Modified subgoals with updated status and trace information
            - Complete timing data for all execution steps
            - Error information and recovery attempt details
            - Tool usage patterns and coordination metadata

    Note:
        The execution process includes sophisticated error recovery through the
        attempt_error_recovery system, enabling graceful handling of tool failures,
        transient errors, and coordination issues that would terminate simpler
        agent architectures. Working memory is continuously updated throughout
        execution to support recovery operations and learning systems.

    Raises:
        Exception: Internal exceptions are captured and processed through the
            recovery system, with unrecoverable errors marked in step traces
            rather than terminating the overall execution process.

    Models tool execution with realistic latency delays and tool-specific failure
    rates that reflect production environment characteristics. Provides the
    foundation for realistic agent performance evaluation by simulating the
    reliability and timing constraints of actual tool integrations.

    Tool failure rates are modeled based on common production patterns, with
    network-dependent tools exhibiting higher failure rates than local computation
    tools, enabling accurate performance assessment under realistic conditions.

    Args:
        tool_name (str): Name of the tool to simulate, used for failure rate
            lookup and result generation. Supported tools include "web_search",

        step (Dict[str, Any]): Execution step context containing tool parameters
            and execution metadata. Currently used for context but may be
            extended for tool-specific parameter passing.
        speed_multiplier (float): Execution speed modifier affecting latency

    Returns:

            contain actual tool results and structured data.
