Module: ai_agents_reality_check/agents/real/real_recovery.py

Multi-strategy error recovery system for production-grade agent architectures.
Implements intelligent failure analysis, retry logic, and fallback strategies
that enable RealAgent to gracefully handle execution failures and maintain
task completion rates under adverse conditions.

This module provides the sophisticated error recovery capabilities that
differentiate production-ready agents from shallow implementations, enabling
continued execution despite tool failures, network issues, and transient errors.

    """Attempt intelligent error recovery using multi-strategy failure analysis.

    Analyzes failed execution steps to determine appropriate recovery strategies
    based on error patterns, tool characteristics, and execution context. Implements
    sophisticated recovery logic including transient error retry, heuristic fallback,
    and graceful degradation that enables continued task execution despite failures.

    The recovery system employs pattern matching to identify transient errors
    suitable for retry operations, tool-specific fallback strategies for recoverable
    failures, and comprehensive tracing of recovery attempts for analysis and
    learning purposes. This multi-layered approach enables production-grade
    reliability under real-world operating conditions.

    Args:
        task_id (str): Unique identifier for the task in progress, used for
            tracing and recovery attempt tracking across the execution context.
        step (Dict[str, Any]): Failed execution step containing:
            - trace (Dict[str, Any]): Error information and execution details
            - last_error (str): Error message for pattern analysis
            - tool (str, optional): Tool name for recovery strategy selection
            - step_id (str, optional): Step identifier for recovery tracking
            - Additional step metadata for recovery decision making
        trace_history (List[Dict[str, Any]]): Complete execution trace history
            for the current task, enabling context-aware recovery decisions
            and pattern analysis across execution steps.

    Returns:
        bool: True if recovery succeeded and the step should be considered
            successfully handled, False if recovery failed and the step
            should be marked as permanently failed.

    Note:
        Recovery strategies are applied in priority order:

        1. **Transient Error Retry** (80% success rate):
        - Triggered by keywords: "timeout", "temporary", "connection",
            "rate limit", "unavailable"
        - Suitable for network issues, temporary service unavailability
        - High success rate reflects transient nature of these errors

        2. **Heuristic Fallback** (30-50% success rate):
        - Tool-specific fallback strategies for recoverable failures
        - Higher success rate (50%) for web_search and file_system tools
        - Lower rate (30%) for other tools reflecting recovery difficulty

        3. **Graceful Failure**:
        - Documents recovery attempt failure for analysis
        - Enables continued execution with degraded functionality
        - Maintains system stability despite unrecoverable errors

        Recovery attempts are comprehensively traced with strategy identification,
        success status, descriptive notes, and unique attempt identifiers for
        detailed analysis and continuous improvement of recovery mechanisms.

    Examples:
        Successful transient error recovery:
            - Error: "Connection timeout to external API"
            - Strategy: "retry" with 80% success probability
            - Result: True, step marked as recovered

        Successful heuristic fallback:
            - Error: "Web search quota exceeded"
            - Tool: "web_search" (50% fallback success rate)
            - Strategy: "heuristic-fallback"
            - Result: True, step bypassed with alternative approach

        Failed recovery attempt:
            - Error: "Invalid authentication credentials"
            - Strategy: "none" (not transient, no fallback applicable)
            - Result: False, step marked permanently failed
