Module: ai_agents_reality_check/agents/wrapper/wrapper_memory.py

No-operation memory implementation simulating the stateless nature of wrapper
agent architectures. Provides interface compatibility across agent types while
accurately representing the absence of persistent memory, context carryover,
and learning capabilities that characterize LLM wrapper implementations.

This module maintains architectural consistency by providing a memory interface
that semantically represents the memory limitations of wrapper agents without
implementing actual memory functionality, enabling realistic performance modeling.

class WrapperMemory:
    """No-operation memory system simulating stateless wrapper agent architecture.

    Implements a memory interface that provides compatibility across agent types
    while accurately representing the absence of persistent memory, context
    management, and learning capabilities that characterize wrapper agent
    implementations. All memory operations are effectively no-ops, reflecting
    the stateless nature of LLM wrapper architectures.

    This class enables consistent memory interface usage across different agent
    types while maintaining semantic accuracy about wrapper agent limitations.
    The implementation provides the appearance of memory functionality without
    actual persistence, accurately modeling the architectural constraints that
    limit wrapper agents to single-shot execution patterns.

    Attributes:
        trace (List): Empty list simulating trace storage without persistence.
        context_window (List): Empty list simulating context storage without retention.

    Note:
        All memory operations are designed to be no-ops or return empty/zero
        values, accurately reflecting the stateless architecture of wrapper
        agents that process each task independently without memory carryover.
