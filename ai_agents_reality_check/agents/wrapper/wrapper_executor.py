Module: ai_agents_reality_check/agents/wrapper/wrapper_executor.py

Single-shot execution engine for stateless wrapper agents with no planning,
memory, or sophisticated error recovery. Models the characteristic failure
patterns of LLM wrappers misrepresented as autonomous agents, providing
the baseline performance tier for architectural benchmarking.

This module implements the execution reality of most production "AI agents":
direct prompt-response patterns that achieve 35-45% success rates through
basic prompt engineering rather than agent architecture.

    """Execute task using stateless wrapper pattern with single LLM call simulation.

    Implements the fundamental wrapper agent execution model: direct task processing
    through a single simulated LLM interaction with complexity-dependent success
    rates, minimal error handling, and no sophisticated recovery mechanisms.
    Represents the architectural baseline that most production "AI agents" actually
    implement despite marketing claims of agent sophistication.

    This function models realistic wrapper performance including complexity-based
    degradation, characteristic failure modes, and the economic efficiency that
    makes wrapper approaches initially attractive despite their reliability limitations.

    Args:
        task (Dict[str, Any]): Task specification containing:
            - task_id (str, optional): Unique identifier, generated if missing
            - name (str, optional): Human-readable task description
            - complexity (TaskComplexity, optional): Difficulty level affecting
            success probability and execution characteristics
            - Additional task parameters (largely unused in wrapper pattern)

    Returns:
        TaskResult: Single-call execution result containing:
            - task_id (str): Unique task identifier
            - task_name (str): Task description for tracking
            - task_type (TaskComplexity): Difficulty classification
            - agent_type (AgentType): WRAPPER_AGENT identifier
            - success (bool): Single-call execution outcome
            - execution_time (float): Actual execution duration
            - error_count (int): Error occurrences (0-3 range)
            - context_retention_score (float): Minimal retention (0.05-0.18)
            - cost_estimate (float): Low cost reflecting simple architecture
            - failure_reason (str, optional): Realistic wrapper failure classification
            - steps_completed (int): 0 or 1 (single-step architecture)
            - total_steps (int): Always 1 (no multi-step capability)

    Note:
        Success rates decrease significantly with task complexity:
        Simple (45%), Moderate (32%), Complex (22%), Enterprise (12%).

        Failure reasons reflect common wrapper patterns including hallucination,
        reasoning failures, context loss, and prompt injection vulnerabilities
        that demonstrate the architectural limitations of stateless approaches.
