Module: ai_agents_reality_check/agents/marketing/marketing_memory.py

Ephemeral memory implementation simulating shallow memory patterns typical of
marketing-driven agent architectures. Provides volatile step-level completion
tracking that mimics basic memory functionality while failing to deliver the
persistent, structured context reuse required for production-grade performance.

This module represents the memory limitations that constrain marketing agents to
intermediate performance levels, demonstrating how superficial memory implementations
create the illusion of sophistication while maintaining architectural fragility.

class EphemeralMemory:
    """Volatile memory store simulating shallow memory patterns in marketing agents.

    Implements a basic key-value store for tracking subgoal completion states during
    task execution, providing the appearance of memory functionality while lacking
    the persistent, structured context reuse capabilities found in production-grade
    agent architectures. This memory system is discarded after task completion,
    preventing the learning and optimization that characterize sophisticated agents.

    The EphemeralMemory class represents the memory limitations that constrain
    marketing agents to intermediate performance tiers, offering enough functionality
    to exceed wrapper agents while remaining fundamentally limited compared to
    semantic memory systems that enable continuous improvement.

    Attributes:
        _memory (Dict[str, Any]): Internal volatile storage for step completion
            markers, cleared between executions to simulate ephemeral behavior.
