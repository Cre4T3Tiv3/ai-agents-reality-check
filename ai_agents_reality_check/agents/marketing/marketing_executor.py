Module: ai_agents_reality_check/agents/marketing/marketing_executor.py

Marketing-tier task execution engine with coordinated subgoal processing.
Implements the execution layer for MarketingAgent, featuring multi-step
orchestration, retry logic, and complexity-aware success rate modeling.

This module ensures MarketingAgent maintains consistent performance hierarchy:
achieving 60-75% success rates that significantly exceed wrapper agents while
remaining inferior to production-grade real agents through shallow recovery
mechanisms and coordination overhead.

    """Execute a multi-step plan using marketing-tier orchestration capabilities.

    Processes a structured plan through coordinated subgoal execution with
    realistic success modeling, retry logic, and error accumulation. Implements
    complexity-aware success rates and coordination penalties to simulate the
    performance characteristics of demo-quality agent implementations.

    This function models the orchestration capabilities typical of marketing-driven
    agents: better than simple wrappers due to planning and retry logic, but
    limited by shallow error recovery and coordination overhead that prevents
    achieving production-grade reliability.

    Args:
        task (Dict[str, Any]): Original task specification containing:
            - task_id (str, optional): Unique task identifier
            - name (str, optional): Human-readable task name
            - complexity (TaskComplexity, optional): Task difficulty level
            - Additional task-specific metadata
        plan (Dict[str, Any]): Structured execution plan containing:
            - subgoals (List[Dict]): Ordered list of execution steps
            - complexity (TaskComplexity): Task difficulty classification
            - task_name (str, optional): Plan-level task identifier
            - Additional planning metadata
        api_call_cost (float): Base cost per execution step for economic modeling.

    Returns:
        TaskResult: Comprehensive execution outcome containing:
            - task_id (str): Unique task identifier
            - task_name (str): Human-readable task description
            - task_type (TaskComplexity): Difficulty classification
            - agent_type (AgentType): MARKETING_AGENT identifier
            - success (bool): Overall execution success status
            - execution_time (float): Total execution duration in seconds
            - error_count (int): Accumulated error count during execution
            - context_retention_score (float): Memory utilization metric (0.0-1.0)
            - cost_estimate (float): Economic cost of plan execution
            - failure_reason (str, optional): Specific failure classification
            - steps_completed (int): Successfully executed subgoals
            - total_steps (int): Total planned subgoals

    Note:
        Success rates are modeled realistically by complexity:
        - Simple tasks: ~78% base success rate
        - Moderate tasks: ~65% base success rate
        - Complex tasks: ~52% base success rate
        - Enterprise tasks: ~35% base success rate

        Coordination penalties increase with task complexity and execution depth,
        simulating the overhead typical of shallow orchestration implementations.
