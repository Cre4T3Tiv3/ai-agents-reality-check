Module: ai_agents_reality_check/agents/recovery.py

Error recovery infrastructure for production-grade agent architectures
providing intelligent retry logic, fallback mechanisms, and progressive
degradation strategies that enable continued task execution despite
subgoal failures and operational constraints.

This module implements the sophisticated error recovery capabilities that
differentiate production-ready agents from shallow implementations,
enabling graceful handling of execution failures through adaptive retry
strategies and comprehensive recovery attempt tracking.

    """Attempt intelligent error recovery with progressive degradation modeling.

    Implements sophisticated error recovery logic that simulates realistic
    fallback mechanisms with decreasing success probability over multiple
    retry attempts. Provides the foundation for agent resilience under
    operational constraints by enabling continued execution despite subgoal
    failures through adaptive retry strategies.

    The recovery system models realistic retry effectiveness patterns with
    progressive degradation that reflects the decreasing likelihood of
    recovery success as retry attempts increase. This enables accurate
    simulation of production-grade error handling capabilities that
    differentiate sophisticated agents from shallow implementations.

    Args:
        task_id (str): Unique task identifier for recovery tracking and
            context correlation across the agent's execution history.
        subgoal (Dict[str, Any]): Failed subgoal dictionary enhanced with
            recovery status, retry count, and error information:
            - status (str): Updated to "recovered" or "failed" based on outcome
            - trace (Dict[str, Any]): Enhanced with recovery metadata including
            recovered flag, retry count, and final error state
            - Additional subgoal context for recovery decision making
        working_memory (Dict[str, Any]): Shared agent memory containing execution
            context, historical patterns, and runtime information that may
            inform recovery strategy selection and effectiveness evaluation.
        retry_count (int, optional): Current retry attempt number for progressive
            degradation calculation. Defaults to 0 for initial recovery attempt.
            Used to decrease success probability with each subsequent retry.
        max_retries (int, optional): Maximum retry limit before permanent failure.
            Defaults to 2 attempts, balancing recovery opportunity with execution
            efficiency in production-grade agent systems.
        speed_multiplier (float, optional): Execution speed modifier for testing
            scenarios affecting recovery delay timing. Values > 1.0 accelerate
            recovery, < 1.0 slow recovery. Defaults to 1.0 for realistic timing.

    Returns:
        bool: Recovery outcome status where True indicates successful recovery
            enabling continued task execution, False indicates permanent failure
            requiring error handling and possible task termination or degradation.

    Note:
        Recovery success modeling uses progressive degradation that reflects
        realistic retry effectiveness patterns:
        - Initial attempt: 60% base success rate
        - Each retry: 25% degradation (60% → 35% → 10% → minimal)
        - Minimum: 10% success floor for edge case recovery scenarios

        Recovery process includes:
        - Realistic delay simulation (0.2-0.6 seconds with speed adjustment)
        - Progressive success probability calculation based on retry count
        - Comprehensive subgoal status and trace information updates
        - Working memory integration for context-aware recovery strategies

        Status updates enable downstream execution coordination:
        - "recovered": Successful recovery, continue execution normally
        - "failed": Permanent failure, trigger error handling or degradation

        Trace enhancements provide detailed recovery analytics:
        - recovered (bool): Recovery attempt outcome for analysis
        - retries (int): Total retry count for performance evaluation
        - last_error (str|None): Final error state for debugging and optimization

    Examples:
        Successful first recovery attempt:
            - retry_count=0, success_chance=60%
            - subgoal["status"] = "recovered"
            - subgoal["trace"]["recovered"] = True
            - Returns True for continued execution

        Failed recovery after retries:
            - retry_count=2, success_chance=10%
            - subgoal["status"] = "failed"
            - subgoal["trace"]["recovered"] = False
            - Returns False for error handling
    """

    retry_success_chance = max(0.1, 0.6 - (retry_count * 0.25))
